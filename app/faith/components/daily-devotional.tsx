          <p>
            Today, remember that your strength comes not from your own abilities, but from the One who created you. As
            you move your body and challenge yourself physically, know that you are honoring the temple God has given
            you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every rep, every step, every moment of discipline is an act of worship. You are not just building muscle or
            losing weightâ€”you are developing the character of Christ within you. Strength and dignity are yours because
            He has clothed you with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Prayer:</strong> Lord, help me to see my fitness journey as part of my spiritual growth. Give me
            strength for today's challenges and help me to laugh with confidence at tomorrow's, knowing You are with me.
            Amen.
          </p>
